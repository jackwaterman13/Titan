This dataset contains data from the Huygens Doppler Wind Experiment (DWE) obtained during the Huygens Mission at Titan.

First Column : Huygens local time, reconstructed from Earth Received Time of the corresponding DWE
Doppler sample and the one-way light time between the receiving antenna and Titan.

Second Column : Huygens altitude above Titan's surface (source DTWG, altitude is defined as radial distance from center of Titan - 2575 km)

Third Column : Huygens zonal wind speed (positive = eastward)

Fourth Column : ZONAL WIND SPEED ERROR, Possible systematic error of zonal speed due to initial Huygens delivery error
